# Introduction
I publish some of my CryptoPP Snippets, I have others, not refactored enough to be published,
but I will publish them as soon as they have a good shape.

# Getting started
This project was created with Visual Studio and using CryptoPP installed by vcpkg which I strongly
recommend, it will download CryptoPP for you, and build it on your system, and make Visual Studio to
detect it automatically without any additional configuration.
Vcpkg in case you don't know is an awesome cross platform C++ package manager.
